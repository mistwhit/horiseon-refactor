# Horiseon - Code Refactor

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to increase the web accessibility of this website so that it would be optimized for search engines.
- This was accomplished through implementing semantic HTML elements, reviewing the logical structure of the HTML elements, adding accessible alt attributes to the image elements, ensuring that heading attributes fell in sequential order, and adding a descriptive title.
